# CODSOFT Java Development Internship - Projects
Welcome to the CODSOFT Java Development Internship repository! This repository contains all the tasks completed as part of the internship, demonstrating my Java development skills through various projects.

# üìã About CODSOFT
CODSOFT is a dynamic community that fosters leadership, learning, and collaboration. It brings together individuals who share common objectives of growth and development, focusing on providing platforms for student engagement, leadership development, and skill-building. The community encourages individuals to take on leadership roles and work on impactful projects across multiple disciplines.

# üõ† About the Internship
During the Java Development Internship at CODSOFT, I completed a variety of projects designed to enhance practical knowledge of Java programming. The internship offered hands-on experience in building Java applications from scratch, reinforcing object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, and applying best coding practices.

# üöÄ Completed Tasks

# 1. Number Guessing Game
The Number Guessing Game is an interactive game where a random number is generated between a predefined range (e.g., 1 to 100), and the player must guess it. The game provides feedback based on the guess (too high, too low, or correct), limits the number of attempts, and allows for multiple rounds.

Features:
Random number generation
Guess validation and feedback
Score tracking based on the number of attempts and rounds
Multiple rounds option

# 2. Student Grade Calculator
This application helps calculate the total marks, average percentage, and assigns grades based on the input marks for multiple subjects. It processes the scores and calculates the results automatically.

Features:
Input marks for each subject
Calculation of total marks
Average percentage calculation
Grade assignment based on percentage
Display of total marks, percentage, and grade

# 3. ATM Interface
The ATM Interface simulates basic banking operations such as checking account balance, depositing money, and withdrawing money. It interacts with a bank account class to perform transactions securely, validating user inputs such as PINs and ensuring balance sufficiency for withdrawals.

Features:
Account balance inquiry
Deposit and withdrawal functionality
Input validation (e.g., PIN verification, withdrawal limit)
User-friendly interface for interacting with the ATM options

# 4. Quiz Application with Timer
A quiz app that presents multiple-choice questions to the user with a set time to answer each one. After answering all the questions, the app calculates the final score and provides feedback on correct and incorrect answers.

Features:
Multiple-choice questions with a timer for each question
Ability to submit answers before time runs out
Score calculation based on correct answers
Summary of correct/incorrect answers at the end

# 5. Student Course Registration System
This system allows students to browse available courses and register for them. Students can also drop courses if needed. The system tracks available slots and ensures that students can only register for courses with remaining capacity.

Features:
Course listing with details such as course code, title, and available slots
Student registration for courses
Option to drop registered courses
Capacity management to track available slots for each course

# üìÇ Repository Structure
CodeSoft/java: Contains the source code for all the projects.
Task1_UnitConverter.java
Task2_NumberGuessingGame.java
Task3_QuizApplication.java
Task4_StudentCourseRegistrationSystem.java
Task5_SimpleATMInterface.java
README.md: This file containing a description of the projects.

# ‚ö° How to Run
Clone the repository using:
git clone https://github.com/iamsunnyyz/CodSoft

Navigate to the task folder and run the respective Java file:
Task1_NumberGuessingGame.java
Task1_NumberGuessingGame

For each task, follow the same steps by replacing the file name. Ensure you have Java installed and configured in your environment.

# üí° Skills Gained
Java fundamentals and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
User input handling and validation
Data processing, calculation, and result generation
Developing user-friendly console applications
Problem-solving and debugging

# üèÜ Completion Criteria
This repository contains five tasks, although the requirement for the internship completion was at least three tasks. All five tasks are included here for additional learning and development purposes.
